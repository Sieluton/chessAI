## Starting a game

At first you will be asked do you want to play against the AI or watch it play against itself.
Only by typing 'y' will the AI play against itself. If you want to play vs the AI just type anything else.

If you chose the AI to play against itself then you will be asked to give time in seconds how long the game should take. If game takes more than the time limit it ends in a tie. This is to prevent the AI vs AI game to go on forever in situtations where it can't find winning moves.

After that you will be asked how deep should AI look for it's move. Any number is okay but numbers larger than 3 will be slow.


## Playing

Every move is given by the game board squares. For example if you want to move whites pawn from square A2 to A3 you type 'a2a3'. This is the case for all the moves, just type first the square you want to move a piece from and then the end square you want it to be moved to. If the move is illegal you will be able to make another one.

Castling is the only move that is bit different, instead of it works by typing a move that would move the king from it's square on top of the rook in which side you want to castle. For example castling long side (left) as white would be 'e1a1'.
