# Unit testing
Almost all of the testing is done with Unit tests.

Test coverage is really bad but it doesn't really reflect the truth.

## Piece rules

Some tests made to test if moves get right response from MoveValidator.

Pawn rules have pretty good coverage here. I might add more for other pieces.

## Piece moves

Tested mostly by playing the game and testing if moves given were played.

All moves have been tested to work properly.

Tests cover some illegal moves.

# Manual testing

Board doesn't really need testing since it's working as intended. Also it is pretty simple and problems in it would be spotted since game wouldn't work correctly.
